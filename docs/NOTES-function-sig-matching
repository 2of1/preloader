thoughts on online matching rules (not in order):
- find function name
- whitespaces stipped until first character
- if just function name, look on previous line for return type
- return type must be in return type list or defaults to int (errors??)
- all whilespaces from function name onwards striped
- function name is case sensitive, all the rest should be lower case
- params list variable names must be stripped
- read until closing bracket even if across multiple lines
